    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Deviled eggs (also known as stuffed eggs, Russian eggs, curried eggs or dressed eggs) are hard-boiled eggs that have
        been shelled, cut in half, and filled with a paste made from the egg yolks mixed with other ingredients such as
        mayonnaise and mustard.</p>
        
        <p>They are generally served cold as a side dish, appetizer or a main course during gatherings or parties. The dish's
        origin can be seen in recipes for boiled, seasoned eggs as far back as ancient Rome, where they were traditionally
        served as a first course. The dish is popular in Europe, North America and Australia.</p>
