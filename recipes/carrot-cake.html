    <h1>Carrot Cake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carrot cake is a sweet and moist spice cake, full of cut carrots and toasted nuts, and covered in cream cheese icing.
        One part of the cake is that the orange flakes of cut carrot give the cake color and texture, along with sweetness and
        moisture.</p>

        <p>Carrot cake may be eaten plain, but it is commonly either glazed or covered with white icing or cream cheese icing and
        walnuts, often cut. Often they are decorated with frosting or marzipan made to look like carrots. They are popular in
        loaf, sheet cake and cupcake form, and (in the United Kingdom as well as North America) can be found pre-packaged at
        grocery stores, and fresh at bakeries. Some carrot cakes are even layered.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>3 cups grated carrots</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>

        <h3>Frosting</h3>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
